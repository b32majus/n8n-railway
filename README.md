## n8n - Free and open fair-code licensed node based Workflow Automation Tool.

This is a [Railway](https://railway.app/)-focused deployment implementation of [n8n](https://n8n.io/).

Use the **Deploy to Railway** button above to launch n8n on Railway. When deploying, make sure to check all configuration options and adjust them to your needs. It's especially important to set `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to a random secure value. 

Refer to the [Heroku n8n tutorial](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/server-setups/heroku/) for more information.
